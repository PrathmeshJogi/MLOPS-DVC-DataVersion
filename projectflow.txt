1.Create git repo and clone it im local/
2.Create code. py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new"data" folder)
Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dy_g.
Now we do "dys init" (creates .dyogugce, .dys)
Now do S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
Now we do "dys remote add -d S3"
Next "dug add data/"
Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r
--cached 'data"'
and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
Again we do "dyg add data/" (creates data.&.dy.c) then "git add . gitig.ngr.e dA.tA.Jyg"
Now - "dyg commit" and then "dyg push"
Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
Now make changes to code. py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dyg status"
Again -
"dyc commit" and then "dyc push"
Then git add-commit-push (we 're saving V2 of our data at this point)
Check Lyg/git status, everything should be upto date.
Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.
