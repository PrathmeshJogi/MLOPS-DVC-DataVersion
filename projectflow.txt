1.Create git repo and clone it im local/
2.Create code. py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new"data" folder)
3.Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
4.Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dyogugce, .dvc)
5.Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6.Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7.Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8.Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9.Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
Now make changes to code. py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dyg status"
Again -
"dyc commit" and then "dyc push"
Then git add-commit-push (we 're saving V2 of our data at this point)
Check Lyg/git status, everything should be upto date.
Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.
